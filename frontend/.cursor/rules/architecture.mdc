### Project Architecture
- We use TanStack Router with file-based routing. Routes are described using Tanstack Router in `src/routes` folder. Always provide your routes with loaders to provide optimal UI.
- We use React Query. Put your queries and mutation in `src/api` folder.
- We use auto-generated API methods based on swagger. Generated method are in @api.gen.ts file.
- For each page, create a corresponding component in `src/pages` directory
- If a component may be helpful in another page, put it in `src/components/{entity}` folder, where `{entity}` is a business entity, i.e. a user, task or an event.
